# Quick Start: Testing the Enhanced Analysis Report

## What Changed?

Your CrewAI analysis results are now beautifully formatted and easy to read! Instead of seeing raw markdown with escape characters, you'll see a professional, visually appealing report.

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend will run at: http://localhost:8000

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

The frontend will run at: http://localhost:5173

### 3. Test the Analysis Flow

1. **Login** to the application
2. **Upload a financial document** (PDF)
3. **Run analysis** with a query like:
   - "Provide a comprehensive analysis of this financial document"
   - "What is the investment recommendation for this company?"
   - "Analyze the financial health and risks"
4. **View the beautiful report!**

## What You'll See

  "execution_time": 45.2,
  "document_validated": true,
  "markdown_content": "# Tesla Investment Recommendation\n\n## Executive Summary...",
  "structured_data": {
    "recommendation": "Hold",
    "executive_summary": "Tesla's Q2 2025 results...",
    "investment_thesis": "**Supporting Evidence:**...",
    "key_strengths": "* Innovation and Technology...",
    "key_risks": "* Execution Risk...",
    "recommendations_section": "* **Conservative Investor:**..."
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see formatted output:

1. **Check backend logs**: Ensure markdown extraction is working
2. **Check browser console**: Look for React errors
3. **Verify dependencies**: Run `pnpm install` in frontend
4. **Clear cache**: Refresh browser with Ctrl+Shift+R

### If markdown looks weird:

1. **Check browser support**: Use modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. **Verify typography plugin**: Should be in `package.json` devDependencies
3. **Check CSS import**: Verify `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"` in `index.css`

## Next Steps
