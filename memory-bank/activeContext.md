# Active Context: Financial Document Analyzer - Full Stack AI Developer Challenge

## Current Work Focus

**FULL-TIME CHALLENGE ACTIVATED!** This is now a comprehensive full-stack AI developer challenge requiring enterprise-level implementation. The project has completed the **database setup** phase (branch: `feat/db-setup`), but now needs complete transformation into a production-ready system with AI-powered document analysis.

## CRITICAL WARNING

**Every single line of code in this repository contains bugs, inefficiencies, or poor practices.** This is not an exaggeration - scrutinize each line of code.

## Bug Tracking System Activated

A comprehensive bug tracking system has been implemented to systematically identify, document, and resolve all issues in the codebase. The bug tracker is located at `memory-bank/bugTracker.md` and contains:

- **10 Critical Bugs Identified**: From mock data to missing authentication
- **Categorized by Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Documentation
- **Status Tracking**: Open, In Progress, Fixed, Verified
- **Systematic Resolution Process**: Document â†’ Fix â†’ Test â†’ Verify

**Current Priority**: Fix critical bugs first to establish working system foundation.

## Recent Changes

Recent database integration work completed:

- `backend/app/database.py` - New database connection module with PostgreSQL and Redis clients
- `backend/app/config.py` - Updated configuration with database settings
- `backend/app/main.py` - Added database initialization on startup/shutdown
- `backend/app/routers/health.py` - Enhanced health checks with database status
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added database dependencies (SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, redis, etc.)
- `backend/docker-compose.yml` - Added PostgreSQL and Redis services
- `backend/env.example` - Updated with database configuration variables
- `backend/DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive database setup guide

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

1. **Backend Foundation**

   - FastAPI application with proper middleware stack
   - CORS, logging, and exception handling middleware
   - Router structure for health, documents, and analytics
   - Pydantic models for data validation
   - Configuration management with Pydantic Settings

2. **API Endpoints**

   - Health check endpoint (`/health`)
   - Document management endpoints (`/documents/*`)
   - Analytics endpoints (`/analytics/*`)
   - Proper error handling and validation

3. **Frontend Foundation**

   - React 19 with TypeScript
   - Vite build system
   - Radix UI component library
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Modern development tooling

4. **Development Environment**

   - Docker configuration with PostgreSQL and Redis services
   - Environment variable management
   - Package management (pnpm for frontend, pip for backend)

5. **Database Integration** âœ…

   - PostgreSQL and Redis connection setup complete
   - Database health checks implemented
   - Connection pooling and error handling configured
   - Docker services configured for development
   - Environment configuration complete
   - **Local database setup verified with TablePlus/DBngin**
   - **PostgreSQL database 'financial_docs' created and tested**
   - **Redis connection verified and working**

### ðŸš§ In Progress

1. **Database Models & Operations**

   - SQLAlchemy models need to be implemented
   - Database migrations need to be set up
   - Mock data needs to be replaced with real database operations

2. **Document Processing**
   - File upload handling implemented
   - Actual document analysis engine pending
   - OCR and data extraction capabilities needed

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Database Models & Migrations**

   - Implement SQLAlchemy models for documents and analysis results
   - Set up Alembic for database migrations
   - Replace mock data with real database operations
   - Add database seeding for development

2. **Document Analysis Engine**

   - Integrate OCR library (Tesseract or PaddleOCR)
   - Implement PDF processing
   - Create data extraction algorithms
   - Add confidence scoring system

3. **Frontend Integration**

   - Connect frontend to real API endpoints
   - Implement document upload UI
   - Create analysis results visualization
   - Add document management interface

4. **Testing & Quality**
   - Add unit tests for backend
   - Add integration tests
   - Frontend component testing
   - End-to-end testing

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Database Choice

- **PostgreSQL** recommended for production
- **SQLite** for development/testing
- Need to implement proper ORM with SQLAlchemy

### Document Processing Strategy

- **OCR-first approach**: Extract text, then parse
- **Template-based parsing**: For common document types
- **ML-based extraction**: For complex documents
- **Hybrid approach**: Combine multiple methods

### Architecture Decisions

- Keep current FastAPI + React architecture
- Implement async processing for large documents
- Use queue system for batch processing
- Add progress tracking for long-running tasks

## Current Blockers

1. **Database Models**: Need to implement SQLAlchemy models and migrations
2. **Document Analysis**: Core functionality not yet implemented
3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: API calls not yet connected
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: No testing framework set up

## Immediate Priorities (Based on Bug Tracker)

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Week 1)

1. **BUG-002**: Implement SQLAlchemy models for documents and analysis results
2. **BUG-001**: Replace mock data with real database operations
3. **BUG-007**: Set up Alembic migrations for database schema management

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)

4. **BUG-004**: Implement actual file processing and analysis pipeline
5. **BUG-003**: Connect frontend to backend APIs with proper service layer
6. **BUG-005**: Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback in frontend

### Phase 3: Security & Quality (Week 3)

7. **BUG-006**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - JWT authentication system with role-based access control implemented
8. **BUG-010**: Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization
9. **BUG-008**: Implement comprehensive test suite for backend and frontend

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish (Week 4)

10. **BUG-009**: Optimize performance for large file processing

## Development Notes

- Backend runs on port 8000
- Frontend runs on port 5173 (Vite default)
- CORS configured for local development
- PostgreSQL runs on port 5432 (Docker)
- Redis runs on port 6379 (Docker)
- Database health checks available at `/health/databases`
- All endpoints currently return mock data (next: implement database models)
- File upload validation implemented but processing pending
